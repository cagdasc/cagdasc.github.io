  I am a self‑motivated and solution focused developer who is interested in state‑of‑the‑art technologies and who has a passion for problem‑solving. Additionally, free open source software development has a special place in my heart. I am currently working at Meditopia which is the world’s most popular mental wellness platform for non-English speakers. My work description is developing Meditopia Mobile application for Android. When I am not working in my main field, I take an interest in contributing open‑source projects, which occupies my free time.
